\section{The Extension of Our Model}
In this section, we extend our model to consider other factor (\eg. time evolution) and discuss how those factors shape our model.

\subsection{The Time Evolution of Charging Station Construction}
\label{time}
When considering the time evolution of the charging station construction, a competition model based on Voltera Equation has been applied. Where the competition relation is given by,

\begin{equation}
\label{competition}
  \frac{d}{dt} N_i = r_i x_i ( 1- \frac{\sum \alpha_{ij}x_j}{K_i})
\end{equation}
Where $N_i$ is the number of a certain specie, $\alpha$ is a second order tensor describing the iteration among different "species". When there are 2 "species", which can be reasonable determined through historical data.

For our case, the problem reduced to a 2 "species" competing problem. Where we set $N_e,N_t$ as the number of electrical vehicles and traditional vehicles respectively.

Therefore the Lotka-Volterra equations are:

\begin{equation}
\label{competition_2}
\left\{
       \begin{array}{lr}
             \frac{d}{dt} N_e & = r_e N_e ( 1- \frac{N_e+\alpha_{12}N_t}{K_1})\\
             \frac{d}{dt} N_t & = r_t N_t ( 1- \frac{N_t+\alpha_{12}N_e}{K_2})
       \end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}



For simplicity, we assume that the total capacity of charging stations is proportional to the number of electrical vehicles $N_e$, i.e.

\begin{equation}
\label{propor}
  \sum Cap(i) \varpropto N_e
\end{equation}

Which indicates that the construction of charing station can be guided by the time evolution of electric vehicles.

For the case in Ireland, we can predict the evolution process based on Equation~\ref{competition_2}, \
and Figure~\ref{fig_evolution} show the result of our prediction.

\subsection{City-based Charger, Rural Charger, Population Density Distribution and Wealth Distribution}

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_stages} the first stage is the current distribution of charging stations in Ireland. 
The algorithm automatically generate the distribution after five years and a decade, which are stage 2 and 3 respectively. 
It shows that the second stage covers most of the cities, villages and towns. 
Which is not surprising since not only does the urban area have a higher population density it also has a higher income per capita. 
It is also worthy noting that the interstate difference of population density as well as disposable income per hose hold may also impact the time evolution process.
