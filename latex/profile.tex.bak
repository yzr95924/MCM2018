\section{The Profile of the Charger Station in US}
\label{sec_profile_us}
\subsection{Amount and Distribution}
By using \emph{Python Scrapy}~\cite{PythonScrapy},
we can get data of Charger Station in \emph{json} format from Tesla's official website.
Table~\ref{table_sample_data} shows the sample of Charger Station data collected by us (\eg, Charger Station id, location of province, longitude, latitude, type, open (0)/close (1) ).

From these data, we find that there are around 4070 charger stations in US,
Currently, nearly 3700 charger stations are open and around 270 charger stations plan to open in the future.
Tesla can provide two types of charging stations: (1) destination charging (2) supercharging.
Figure~\ref{fig_composition_rate} shows rates of four different types of site in the data we collected.
We can find that nearly $84\%$ sites are destination chargers,
and the rate of superchargers is around $12\%$, which is much less than the amount of destination chargers.

Beside the data of the amount of charge stations,
we also collect the distribution of  charger stations and the road map of US by \emph{Python Scrapy},
which can be seen from Figure~\ref{fig_charger_distribution} and Figure~\ref{fig_road_map} respectively.

By analysing those data above, we can get three conclusions:
\begin{conclusion}
\label{conclusion_1}
Because of the density of roads, Tesla prefers to construct super charging stations in the area with low density of roads and destination charging station in the area with high density of roads.
\end{conclusion}
\begin{conclusion}
\label{conclusion_2}
As for features of various areas (\eg. urban, suburban, rural area......), Tesla prefers to more super charging stations in suburban and rural area and more destination charging stations in urban.
\end{conclusion}
\begin{conclusion}
\label{conclusion_3}
Tesla plans to deploy more super charging station in area of suburban in the future.
\end{conclusion}

\subsection{The Type of Charging Station}
According to the data collected by us above,
we can regard a charging station as a point with four kinds of attributes $sta(x, y, type, R)$.
Specifically, $x$, $y$ are the longitude and latitude of that charging station respectively.
$type$ is its charging type (\eg, destination charging, supercharging),
and $R$ is the maximum driving range provided by $sta(x, y, type, R)$.

To the type of supercharging,
we find it can provide up to $170$ miles of range~\cite{SuperRange},
so we have $R_{super} = 170miles \approx 272km$.

As for the type of destination charging,
we consider that it can provide the maximum driving range of the car serviced by it.
Thus, $R_{destination}$ depends on the type of the car.
To simplify our model, we assume the the type of our target car is "Tesla Model 3"~\cite{CarRange}.
According to factors of "Tesla Model 3", the standard maximum range of it is $350km$,
so we have $R_{destination} = 350km$.
As a result, we have:
\begin{equation}
\label{equ_R}
\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& R_{super} = 272km \\
& R_{destination} = 350km \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}

\subsection{The Evaluation of US's Charging Station Network }
To evaluate whether Tesla can allow a complete switch to all-electric in the US,
we first need to identify the successful condition of a complete switch to all-electric in the US.

It is easy to understand the fact if the network can support a complete switch to all-electric,
a electric vehicle must can any other charging station from the location of a specific charging station,
so that it would not be confined in fixed area and can traverse to anywhere of the whole expected reachable area.

Based on this idea, we can give the definition of the successful condition of a complete switch to all-electric in the US.
\begin{definition}
\label{def_successful_condtion}
\textbf{Successful Switch Condition:}
Suppose a target area $a$ can support a complete switch to all-electric,
then for every charing station $sta(x, y, type, R)$ in its network,
it can traverse to any other charging station in this network.
\end{definition}

We can model the network as a graph $G_{a}(Vertex, Edge)$. 
All the sites of charing stations consist the set of vertexes $Vertex$,
for a specific site $i$, other sites $j$ that meet the distance $d(i,j) \leqslant R_{type}$ should have an edge $(i,j)$ between them.
All the edge consist the set $Edge$.
and the value of a edge can be quantify as the distance.  
With Definition~\ref{def_successful_condtion},
we can regard it as the \textbf{Connectivity of the Graph}~\cite{connectivity}, 
which means if the $G_{a}(Vertex, Edge)$ of area $a$ is a \textbf{Strongly Connected Graph}, 
then it can support a complete switch to all-electric in $a$.

With the analysis above, 
we convert the original problem to identifying whether the charging station graph $G_{US}(Vertex, Edge)$ of US is a Strongly Connected Graph.
With many classic algorithm regarding to Strongly Connected Graph~\cite{connectivity_algo},
we can do the calculation to get the conclusion.

By our calculation, we find that the charging station
