\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec_conclusion}
Considering the problem of the charging station network in the United States,
We find that the charging station network in US cannot support a successful migration towards all'electric personal transportation in the United States,
because there exists the failure case caused by $R_{super} \leq R_{destination}$.
In our model, the total number of charging station support a successful migration towards all'electric personal transportation in the United States  is around 3792,
which is higher than the number of current deployment.

For the problem of determining the optimal number, placement, and distribution in Ireland,
we use the algorithm to find the optimal solution and the result is showed in Figure~\ref{fig_stages}.
We also discuss how other factors (\eg. population distribution, wealth distribution.......) influence our model,
and show the result with various rates of the electric vehicle in Ireland.
We find that those factors mainly shape the first layer in our process architecture.
Thus, the algorithm can also work well in different cases. And the key factors in our model are service capacity $demand(i)$ and the cost of construction $c_i$ in site $i$.
